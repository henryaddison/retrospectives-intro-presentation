# WARNING

This talk is focussed on agile retrospectives for a tech team on a project.

But they don't have to.

--

# Why?

Make the team happier: Simpleweb measure of success.

Continuous improvement of the team.

Lots of cleverer people than me recommend them.

--

# Who?

The devs working on a project.

If you're a one man team then maybe just a one-on-one catch up with another dev.

If there's only two of you then you might get away being less formal.

--

# When?

Often enough that events are still fresh.

Not so often you don't have time to work and change things.

I recommend regular schedule or else it doesn't happen.

--

# How?

1. Start
2. Gather Data
3. Generate Insight
4. Decide Actions
5. End

--

# How?

## Gather Data example

Before the retrospective, the team is asked to prepare up to 6 items which answer one of:
* what to **start** doing?
* what to **continue** doing?
* what to **stop** doing?

At the retrospective, in turn everyone shares an item.

--

# How?

## Generate Insight example

Discuss the presented items as a group:
* Give everyone a fixed amount of time to lead the discussion so they can focus on what they want.
* Try and discuss items rather than solutions at this stage.

Afterwards, group together similar items.

--

# How?

## Decide Actions example

Better to fix a few things than mull over many things.

Decide what to focus on by voting on the items (e.g. everyone gets two votes to decide the top 3 most important items).

Then assign actions or items to people.

--

# How?

Ultimately up to the team.
